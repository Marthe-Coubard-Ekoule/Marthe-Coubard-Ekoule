## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I currently work as an Associate Lecturer at ARU Cambridge. I graduated from ARU with a Master's degree in Information, Communication, and Technology in 2021.

I am passionate about web development, engineering, and artificial intelligence. I am working on my research project in artificial intelligence.

I am currently looking for financial support for my PhD research. My goal is to work as a Lecturer after completing my PhD. I enjoy coding and reading about programming languages.

The programming languages I am skilled in include Python, Java, JavaScript, and PHP.

I am self-taught in Node.js, React.js, SQL, MySQL, Django, Power BI, Object-oriented Programming, Sass, Bootstrap, Git & Github, TypeScript, Express.js, Vue, and React Native.

I am always open to learning new languages and new things because I love learning.
